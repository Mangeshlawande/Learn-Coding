Thread states Thread Priority Synchronization
    1.new thread
    2.runnable thread
    3.not runnable thread
    4.Dead thread

    1.new thread
        all new thread are runnable(t1,t2,t3...)

    2.runnable thread
        when the start method invoked on a new() thread ,it gets to running by calling run method
        it actually may running or may awaiting it turn to run 


    3.not runnable thread 
        the thread is stop for some input operation called not runnable thread
        switching from not runnable state 
            to runnable  to take input 
            suspended thread to resume()(if thread has suspended then it's resume method must be invoked)
            notify() or notifyAll() call to invoke this situation 
            if a thread is blocked by on input/output 

    4.Dead thread
        last state 
        when run method call stop method 
        At this state the thread can't run again  bcoz it's Dead

    thread  start live in the ready to run state , you can called only the start and stop method when
    thread is in this state(new state) start(), stop() 
    if you will try run another function then illegal thread exception occurred   or 
    calling any methode beside start and stop causes an illegal thread exception(error)

        2 types of error :
            1.compile time error (normally syntax error )
            2. runtime error (logical error)(exception )

        java handle exception it terminate program ;
        Hence programmer handle Exceptions, we use try catch to handle exception

MultiThreading Drawback:
     if 2 person have same joint account and it withdraw money at same time
     means 2 threads run asynchronously / concurrently then balance is negative state 
     it is not legal for good software..
     array is asynchronousized types
     To make thread safe, we need to apply Synchronization
        defination: When we start two or more threadwithin a program there may be situation ,when mutliple thread 
        try to access same resource i.e. bank joint account, so there is need of Synchronize the action of mutliple
        thread and make sure only one thread can access the resource at given point in time.

Thread Priority:
    Assign a value to thread function 
    function Name : 
    1.setPriority()
    2. getPriority()
    we can set predefined static variable called MIN_PRIORITY; 
    Thread.MIN_PRIORITY
    instead of that we can use 0 as MIN_PRIORITY , when creating an object eg., setPriority(0) as lowest Priority
    NORM_PRIORITY(5) is default Priority
    MAX_PRIORITY(10) is maximum Priority

In java for taking the input from user named scanner class 
we need to make object of this class ,This class is present in util class 
import java.util.Scanner;  // for 1 class 
import java.util.*; // for all class 

syntax: 
   Scanner s1 = Scanner(System.in); //, in is static var 
   int x = s1.nextInt();

    //scanner  class ke nextInt() name ka function hota hai 

    the input is stored in buffer , System.in is used to connect the buffer and keyboard;
    buffer main raw type ka data hota hai, store enter button at last;
    nextInt function raw to int if possible;
